# TensorLib

First attempt at a C++ project implementing machine learning algorithms.

# Meta Goals:
1) Learn C++
2) Get more comfortable with machine learning nomenclature and algorithms
3) Learn CMake
4) Dependency management with CMake and C++


# Subgoals 

#### Learn C++ subgoals:
 a) Get comfortable with how C++ containers and iterators. As such, a `Tensor` implementation was made. (`std::vector` abstracted all these details away from me, so I wanted to reimplement to get a better understanding of how C++ containers are made)
 
 b) Play around with modern C++ features like concepts, and using them on templates. 
 
 c) Use useful free functions existing in the STL.
